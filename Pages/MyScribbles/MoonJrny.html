   	<h3> The study of the space, the endless abyss beyond, is called astronomy. Astronomers 
	     study this infinite void to learn , and one day, explore it. Astronomy has existed 
             for as long as humanity has. From the primitive calendars, to knowing about black holes 
             and neutron stars, we have come a long way.</br>

        <h3> The soviet union was the first to explore the vast expanse of space in person. The first 
             ever spacecraft, Sputnik-1, and the first person in space were launched by them. But the 
             U.S.A was the first country to land a person on the moon with Apollo-11. They continued 
             exploration of the lunar surface till Apollo-17.</br>

        <h3> India also set her sights on the moon with Chandrayaan-1, in 2008, and it was a sucess. 
             Chandrayan-2 however, was a catastrophic failure due to a software glitch. But on the 23rd 
             of August, we managed to land on the south pole of the moon. This was celebrated by every 
             citizen of our country. What a marvellous accomplishment by the scientisits at the Indian Space Research Organisation!</br>
	     </h3>
        <p></br></p>
        <h3> The sucess of Chandrayaan-3 inspires us to continue pushing the boundaries of our knowledge, 
             reminding us that our pursuit of the universe's mysteries knows no bounds.</br>
