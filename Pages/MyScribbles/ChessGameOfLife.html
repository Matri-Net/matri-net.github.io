   	<h5> The lowly pawns</br>
         Protect their King</br>
         They sacrifice their lives</br>
         All for nothing</br>
         But their king still stands</br>
         With knights, bishops and rooks</br> 
         Along with his queen,</br>
         They are nothing but crooks</br> </h5>        
        <p></br></p>
        
    <h5>The knights attack violently </br>
        They jump around not very silently</br>
        At last, they get killed</br>
        Just like a person billed</br>
        The bishops move</br>
        They dance and groove</br>
        Alas, they get killed by the rooks and the queen</br>
        But a lone pawn, marching, could be seen.</br></h5>
        <p></br></p>

    <h5>The pawn marches forward</br>
        It goes through the board upward</br>
        Finally, it gains power</br>
	    The other pieces, in fear, cover.</br>
        The pawn, now queen, fights bravely</br>
        It and the other side's queen exchange dramatically </br>
        But at the end, all that remains is the mastermind himself</br>
        One whose power not even the pawns could gain <br/>
        The King now has all but pain.</br></h5>
	<p><br/></p>

    <h5>But the most interesting thing of all</br>
        Is that both sides were played by the same lust</br>
        Power</br></h5>
	<p><br/></p>
