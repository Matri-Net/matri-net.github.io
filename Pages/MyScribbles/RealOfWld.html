   	<h3> Finally I had the chance to confess the truth! the man thought."People will finally belive! me!" 
             he said to himeself. He was watching the news, in the cafeteria of a prison. He got up from the 
             cold, rusted metal bench he was sitting on. He waited for a guard to pass by. But nobody came. He 
             looked around searched each room of the prison. He asked his fellow inmates where anyone of the 
             authority could be found. They all brushed him off.</br>
	     </h3>
        <p></br></p>
        <h3> It was as if 'they' were trying to keep him from reveling his big sceret. But why would 'they' keep 
             him alive? He had no value to his former captors, the people who put him in this very place. Soon, 
             one by one the other inmates disappeared. By the end of the day. He was scrambling around, his breath 
             short."Hello! is there any on here?" he shouted. At midnight, he found pickaxe in the prison mines. 
             He dug his way out of the building, one swing at a time.Eventually he saw a glimpse of light.He ran 
             away towards the city. He noticed something, he found proof.  Proof of his thoery for which he was put 
             in prison.</br>

        <p></br></p>
        <h3> Quite a while back, the man had proposed that the world was a simulation. The government, or what he
             thought was the government put him in the highest security prison. Today, on the television news, 
             that there was proof of the world being fake was blaring on the screen. "Sceintist have discovered 
             that only a certain amount of information can be stored in a particle, which seems to be the proof 
             of creation", the reporter said.</br>
	     </h3>
        <p></br></p>
        <h3> However, even more proof came as the world collapsed around him. The man noticed that the visual 
             abberation appeared. He realised that the world was not a simulation, his world was.  </br>
             </h3>
